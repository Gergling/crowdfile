Themes:
* All profiles can be modified by the general public.
* Everyone logs in as themselves.
* People vote on a preferred profile photo.
* Duplicates are found by somebody making an initial suggestion for a duplicate.
  * Duplicates are handled by voting for or against the profile being a duplicate.
  * If more than half the contributors to both profiles vote in favour of there being a duplicate, a merged profile is created, by adding in all attributes and photos from both profiles. 
  * Merge profiles may disappear if people retract their votes from the duplication ratings.
  * If a merge profile exists, users are directed there for the person, unless they specifically navigate away
* One profile can exist per user. A name has to be given. The user is strongly advised to start with some unique profile information.
